# dino-proj
Chrome Dinosaur automation project which uses image processing. pillow library and pyautogui library are needed  

the code is in python
these libraries must be installed
to install use this commands in windows terminal 

1. pip install pyautogui
2. pip insatll pillow


this code may not be perfect, as the speed increases the obstacle distancing and speed also matters
and time taken for the jump is constant so as the speed increases the next obstacle may hit the dinosaur.
To fix this i will make some modifications to the source code of the game.
Check it in my gitrhub profile
